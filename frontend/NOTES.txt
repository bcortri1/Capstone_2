Current Known Bugs:
-Adding notes and paths too quickly while page loads leads to inconsistent issues with notes not being played


Odd Design Behaviors (may decide to change later):
-Paths do not delete when blocks are deleted, leaving an empty block and path
-All paths loop when one path does
-Samples cannot be lengthened but can be shortened (limitation of Sample player, grain player would be required)
