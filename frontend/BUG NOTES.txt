===========================================================
Current Known Bugs:
-Looping notes for longer than 300~ seconds sees noticable crackling which does not go away(May be a limitation of the current implementation and/or library)
-Spam clicking play/pause causes non-appbreaking unpredictable behavior (unimportant)
-Adding notes and paths too quickly while page loads leads to inconsistent issues with notes not being played (Could have interaction halt until loading is done)

*While Frustrating none of these break are appbreaking*

===========================================================
Odd Design Behaviors (may decide to change later):
-Paths do not delete when blocks are deleted, leaving an empty block and path
-All paths loop when one path does (could be redone with Tone JS Part to allow for invidual path looping, may solve crackling issue)
-Samples cannot be lengthened but can be shortened (limitation of Sample player, Grain player would be required)
